# Charting a column chart using ordinal data

Since you've already covered the basics in [Part 1](#) let's jump right into part two.

## 1. Get your data ready

Ordinal charts take data in a very similar way to time charts. The only difference is that the top left cell shouldn't be "date." This will let chartbuilder know that your x-axis is supposed to be categories.

## 2. Paste it into Chartbuilder from your spreadsheet software

[This is the data](https://docs.google.com/a/qz.com/spreadsheets/d/1xScjLJvFk1a0RjRWedi4ICmpeAMJ4t3s0HCZ3ROeSbg/edit#gid=81401387) we'll use during this tutorial but if you're confident, try using your own.

When you copy and paste into Chartbuilder the chart should update with a bunch into a single line

lets change those to columns by clicking the "Columns" button

## 3. Change the series to columns

In each series options change the selector from line to column.

your chart should look like this right now.

## 4. Adjust the axes

The left axis ranges from 0 to 0.9 with ticks at 0.225, 0.450, and 0.675. Let's make those values nicer by changing the axis max to 1.0 and the number of ticks to 5.

This data is in billions of dollars so add "$" in the prefix field and " billion" in the suffix field

## 5. Add a title and source

You did this in [Part 1](basic-chart.md) so head there if you need a refresher.

A title of "Baggage fees collected, 2014" and a source of "US Department of Transportation" should suffice

Your Chartbuilder should now look like this
