# Bar chart with ranking data

So far you've made a [time series chart](basic-chart.md) and a [column chart](column-chart-ordinal-data.md) in this tutorial you're going to make a ranked bar chart.

## 1. Prepare your data
Chartbuilder wont' sort or transform your data, so you need to make sure it's sorted large to small or small to large in your spreadsheet software. Here are the instructions on how to do that in [Excel](https://support.office.com/en-in/article/Sort-data-in-a-range-or-table-62d0b95d-2a90-4610-a6ae-2e545c4a4654) and here is how you do that in [Google Drive](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/181254?hl=en)

## 2. Paste your data in to chartbuilder
[This is the data](https://docs.google.com/a/qz.com/spreadsheets/d/1xScjLJvFk1a0RjRWedi4ICmpeAMJ4t3s0HCZ3ROeSbg/edit#gid=433721600) we'll use during this tutorial but if you're confident, try using your own.

When you copy and paste into Chartbuilder the chart should update as one line like this
