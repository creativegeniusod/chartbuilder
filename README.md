* The app has been rewritten in React.js, making it easier to add new chart types or use
third-party rendering libraries.
* Chart edits are automatically saved to localStorage, and a chart can be
recovered by clicking the "load previous chart" button on loading the page.
* Data input now accepts csv formatted data as well as tsv formated data
* All UI elements belong to [Chartbuilder UI](https://github.com/Quartz/chartbuilder-ui),
a framework of flexible React components that you can use in other projects.
